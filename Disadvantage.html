   <P> One of the key features that distinguishes us, humans, from everything else in the world is
intelligence. This ability to understand, apply knowledge and improve skills has played a
significant role in our evolution and establishing human civilization. But many people (including
Elon Musk the founder of â€¦.) believe that the advancement in technology can create a
superintelligence that can threaten human existence.
Every technology has some disadvantages, and the same goes for Artificial intelligence. Being so
advantageous technology still, it has some disadvantages which we need to keep in our mind while
creating an AI system. Following are the disadvantages of AI:
High Cost: The hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as it requires lots
of maintenance to meet current world requirements.
 Can't think out of the box: Even we are making smarter machines with AI, but still they
cannot work out of the box, as the robot will only do that work for which they are trained,
or programmed.
No feelings and emotions: AI machines can be an outstanding performer, but still it does
not have the feeling so it cannot make any kind of emotional attachment with humans, and
may sometime be harmful for users if the proper care is not taken.
Increase dependence on machines: With the increment of technology, people are getting
more dependent on devices and hence they are losing their mental capabilities.
No Original Creativity: As humans are so creative and can imagine some new ideas but
still AI machines cannot beat this power of human intelligence and cannot be creative and
imaginative.</P>

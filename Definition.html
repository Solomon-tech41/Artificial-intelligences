        <p>Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", or “the ability to learn
            and solve problems” hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power."
            So, we can define Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the branch of computer science by which we can
            create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make
            decisions.
            Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is the
            information acquired through experience. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure
            (training). Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural 
            (i.e., human beings) ‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained
            through exposure.”</p>
